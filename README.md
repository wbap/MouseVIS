## Connectome informatics
The goal of [our research project](https://github.com/wbap/MouseVIS/blob/master/ConnectomeInformatics_DAIL.pdf) is to establish connectome informatics, a methodology for exploiting brain networks to unveil the architecture of information processing in the brain. A key strategy of connectome informatics is to reveal the community structure of brain networks, where the word ‘community’ refers generally  to a group of vertices of the network that are connected at higher probability with each other than with those outside the group  [1]. This strategy is based on the hypothesis that communities of brain networks are associated with functional modules of information processing in the brain.  
## Mouse visual cortical network
We have focussed upon the visual cortex. Taking ten visual cortical regions as vertices and exploiting the high-resolution connectivity data recently published from the Allen Brain Atlas (https://github.com/AllenInstitute/mouse_connectivity_models), we have calculated the connection strengths between these regions.
